// Jump targets
//
// A jump target is an abstraction of a control-flow target in generated
// code.  It encapsulates an assembler label and an expected virtual frame
// layout at that label.  The first time control flow reaches the target,
// either via jumping or branching or by binding the target, the expected
// frame is set.  If control flow subsequently reaches the target, code may
// be emitted to ensure that the current frame matches the expected frame.
//
// A jump target must have been reached via control flow (either by jumping,
// branching, or falling through) when it is bound.  In particular, this
// means that at least one of the control-flow graph edges reaching the
// target must be a forward edge and must be compiled before any backward
// edges.
