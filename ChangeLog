2008-07-09: Version 0.1.1 (126448)

        Fixed bug in stack overflow check code for IA-32 targets where a
        non-tagged value in register eax was pushed to the stack.

        Fixed potential quadratic behavior when converting strings to
        numbers.

        Fixed bug where the return value from Object::SetProperty could
        end up being the property holder instead of the written value.

        Improved debugger support by allowing nested break points and by
        dealing with stack-overflows when compiling functions before
        setting break points in them.
